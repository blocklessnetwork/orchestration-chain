# blocklesschain

**blocklesschain** is a blockchain built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint and created with [Ignite CLI](https://ignite.com/cli). It's current support is limited to **amd64** environments.

## Get started

```
ignite chain serve
```

`serve` command installs dependencies, builds, initializes, and starts your blockchain in development.

### Configure

Your blockchain in development can be configured with `config.yml`. To learn more, see the [Ignite CLI docs](https://docs.ignite.com).

### Web Frontend

Ignite CLI has scaffolded a Vue.js-based web app in the `vue` directory. Run the following commands to install dependencies and start the app:

```
cd vue
npm install
npm run serve
```

The frontend app is built using the `@starport/vue` and `@starport/vuex` packages. For details, see the [monorepo for Ignite front-end development](https://github.com/ignite-hq/web).

### Install

To install the latest version of your blockchain node's binary, execute the following command on your machine:

curl

```bash
sudo sh -c "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/txlabs/blockless-chain/main/download.sh | bash"
```

wget

```bash
sudo sh -c "wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/txlabs/blockless-cli/main/download.sh -v -O download.sh; chmod +x download.sh; ./download.sh; rm -rf download.sh"
